High level overview of functions for MatrixeQTL/glmnet
Prioritize correctness,modularity,and readability (in that order)

Functions
  Read in SNP data
    This function could utilize two methods:
      Read in SNP data that can be relatively easily be loaded into memory (sqldf)
      Read in SNP data that is too large to be read into memory (either matrixEQTL or memory mapped file)

  Read in expression data
    sqldf

  subsample function
    given a number of samples to hold out for training and testing, create training and testing set in list form


Processing samples
  Matrix eQTL needs to be run on subsampled SNP and expression matrices.  This is complicated due to the sampling with replacement, as MatrixEQTL returns an error when a matrix has duplicated columns.  Possible solutions are to sample without replacement, or to create new names for the columns, and then rework which samples are which
  Instead, we're simply going to sample without replacement.
